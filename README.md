# remove_outliers
Remove outliers using function and without function 
 Removing outliers can significantly increase the statistical power of machine learning model hence it is recommended that you treat outliers before building a model. Z score indicates how many standard deviation away a given sample is. 
we can remove outliers using three ways
1. percentile 
2. standard deviation 
3. using Z-score 

In this code I'm removing outliers using z_score.
